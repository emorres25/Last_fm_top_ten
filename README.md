The first program

This being my first ever useful program, and an entry point to the world of programming that I actually found interesting, can be a very sloppy bit of code. 
Any kind of suggestions, improvements are welcome.

Also, since I'm new to GitHub, and taking my time to learn about this crazy new world which I have been trying to understand since the past 2 hours, please ignore any stupidity that you may find in my profile, or this repo.

Thanks
